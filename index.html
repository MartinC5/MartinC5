    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of South Wales, currently in my first year after completing the Foundation year. As a Student Course Representative for both Year 0 (Foundation) and Year 1, I take pride in being a voice for my fellow students, ensuring their concerns and feedback are heard and acted upon by the faculty.
<br><br>
Gaming is a huge part of my life and drives my passion for technology, coding, and exploring the digital world. I’m fluent in both English and Arabic, and being British and Jordanian has given me a unique cultural perspective. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have experience with Unity and enjoy working with various coding languages, including C++, HTML5, and CSS. Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by learning Python.
       <br><br>
       Outside of my studies, I’m an adventurous person. I’m a Junior Advanced Open Water Diver (PADI), having completed over 10 dives in the Red Sea – Aqaba, and I also ski at an intermediate level. Football and table tennis are other activities I enjoy to stay active. When I’m not diving or skiing, I love cooking for friends and family, bowling, and go-karting.
        I’m passionate about travel, coding, and exploring new music genres. I also enjoy tennis and horse riding. Whether it’s coding a new project, enjoying a thrilling game, or exploring the world, I am always eager to learn, create, and experience new things.</p>

            <strong>Triangle Area Calculator</strong>
            <p>Description: This program calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. It asks the user to input the lengths of the three sides, checks if they can form a valid triangle, and then computes the area if they are valid. If the sides don't form a triangle, the program notifies the user</p>

            <strong>Tons Conversion Table Generator</strong>
            <p>Description: This program generates a conversion table that converts values in tons to both pounds and kilograms. It uses a loop to calculate and display the corresponding values for tons in increments of 2, starting from 2 tons up to 20 tons. The results are neatly presented in a table format, showing tons, pounds, and kilograms, with proper alignment for readability</p>

            <strong>Coin Toss Game</strong>
            <p>Description: This simple program simulates a coin toss game. The user chooses either "H" for heads or "T" for tails. The program randomly generates a coin toss result and checks if it matches the user's choice. It then displays a message saying whether the user won or lost based on the result.</p>

            <strong>Average Speed Calculator</strong>
            <p>Description: This program calculates the average speed of a journey that consists of two segments: from City X to City Y, and from City Y to City Z. The user provides the distances and times for both segments, and the program computes the average speed for the entire trip based on these inputs. The result is displayed in kilometers per hour (Km/H).</p>

            <strong>Random Rainbow Six Siege Operator Pair Generator]</strong>
            <p>Description: This program randomly generates pairs of attacking and defending operators from the popular game Rainbow Six Siege. The user doesn't need to input anything; the program automatically selects random pairs, displaying the attacker and defender for each pair. The program runs this process three times, generating three random operator pairs. Each pair is associated with their respective roles (Attacker and Defender) and is displayed to the user in the console.</p>
